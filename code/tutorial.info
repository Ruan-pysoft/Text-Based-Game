Tutorial:
 =========


(I suggest playing this tutorial in full screen, otherwise you may need to scroll around sometimes)

  When choosing "Start a new game" from the main menu you will be confronted with the following screen:
    Choose a map:
     ==========


    1) Map 1
    2) Map 2
    ...
    n) Map n
    Q) Quit to Title

    Choose a map:
  On this screen you are expected to select a map to play on. You select a map by typing the number in front of the ")" and then pressing ENTER. You can also quit to
  title using "Q" or "q" in stead of a number.
  In this tutorial we will assume you have selected "basic world", one of the three default maps that comes with the game, and is map 1 by default.

  When you have selected the "basic world" map you will see the following screen:

            You find yourself in a cave with a flickering torch on the wall.
            You can make out four paths, each equally as dark and foreboding.


    Play Turn 1, Choose an Action:

    d: Move East
    a: Move West
    w: Move North
    s: Move South
    e: View Inventory
    r: Rest
    R: Rest until healed
    stats: View stats
    Menu: Save/Load/Quit Game
    Action:
So what does all this mean? Well, I'll split it up into sections.

  SECTION I: Room Description:

            You find yourself in a cave with a flickering torch on the wall.
            You can make out four paths, each equally as dark and foreboding.

  This is just so that you know what the room you are in looks like, and has no purpose except to make the game playable. (Without it, it would be like stumbling
  around, deaf and blind in the map, only knowing in what direction you can go, what items you have, and how hurt you are)

SECTION II: Play turn:

    Play Turn 1, Choose an Action:

  This only tells you how long you've been playing.

SECTION III: Action:

    d: Move East
    a: Move West
    w: Move North
    s: Move South
    e: View Inventory
    r: Rest
    R: Rest until healed
    stats: View stats
    Menu: Save/Load/Quit Game
    Action:

  This is where you do stuff.

  So, firstly, you can move around:

    d: Move East
    a: Move West
    w: Move North
    s: Move South
    Action:

  Let me explain. You're in a world, so let me draw (badly drawn) a map for you:
____________
|      !!  |
|  ¢¢__:(  |
|    __    |
|    __    |
|X(__::__$$|
|    ¢¢    |
|    __    |
|    :(    |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  So, to clarify, every two symbols next to each other are one room. So let me give you the map key:

    KEY:
    :: = Where you start
       = Nothing, can't go here
    __ = Empty room
    :( = Room with a certain enemy in it
    ¢¢ = Room with only a coin in it
    $$ = Room with a lot of loot in it
    X( = Room with an enemy in it that can explode if it has low health

  As you can see, there are rooms surrounding you on all sides, and because of that you can move in four directions (you cannot move diagonally). If you were to select
  "d" (by pressing the "d" key and then pressing ENTER), you would go "right" on this map, and "a" would make you go "left". If you were to select "w" you would go
  "up", and "s" would make you go "down".

  Secondly, you can view your stats and save/exit your game (or load a new one):

    e: View Inventory
    stats: View stats
    Menu: Save/Load/Quit Game
    Action:

  So if you select "e", you can see what items you have:

    Action: e

    ==========
    Inventory:

    Silver Coin
    =====
    A round coin with 10 stamped on the front.
    Value: 10


    Rock
    =====
    A fist-sized rock, suitable for bludgeoning.
    Value: 0
    Damage: 6

  As you can see, you start this map with only a silver coin and a rock.
  Your second option is to view your health and other stats:

    Action: stats

    ==========
    Health:
    50/50HP
    ==========
    Damage:
    1.0
    ==========
    Damage Resistance:
    Blunt: 8.9%
    Sharp: 9.0%
    Explosion: -31.0%
    ==========

  As you can see, this game's damage system is not as simple as it may look at first glance (NOTE: Your resistances are randomly generated within a certain range
  every time you start a new game). It has three types of damage: Blunt damage, Sharpness damage and Explosion damage. You may be confused about the negative
  Explosion damage, but all that it means is that if something deals 10 explosion damage to you, your health will go down with 13.1 HP, instead of 9.1 HP, if it was
  sharpness damage.
  And lastly, you can save your game, load a old save, or quit to the main menu.
